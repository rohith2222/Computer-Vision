# Geometry
**CSE 473/573 3D Geometry Project.**

The following commands should be executed in the root folder of the project.
**task 1 testing**

```bash
python task1.py --alpha 45 --beta 30 --gamma 50
```

**task 2 testing**

```bash
python task2.py
```

**Pack your submission**
Note that when packing your submission, the script would run your code before packing.
```bash
sh pack_submission.sh <Your_UBIT_name>
```
Change **<Your_UBIT_name>** with your UBIT name.
The resulting zip file should be named **"submission\_<Your_UBIT_name>.zip"**, and it should contain 3 files, named **"result_task1.json"**, **"result_task2.json,"**, and **"UB\_Geometry"**. If not, there is something wrong with your code/filename, please go back and check.

You should only submit the zip file.
